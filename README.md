The final project will be similar to the Health Check App that exists on Campus, but with some modifications. It will implement something similar to Criminal Intent, in the sense that there will be a list of events and times where the Check-In needs to be filled in as will implement forward and next buttons that are necessary during the times when account information is being filled in. Moreover, it will include Toasts in order to display. 

Each of these four components would work in different ways:

- While filling in account and person information, Buttons moving to the left and to the right will serve as a transition between various questions such as "What is your name?", "What is your date of birth?", etc.

- The Criminal Intent-type List would indicate various places and/or events one would need to check in before-hand. The List would display places that still needed information to be filled out or, inside it, would include the "GO/STOP" drawable if the information was already filled out.

- The DatePicker/TimePicker concepts would be used in order to set the time and date of such events given that events themselves need to be filled out repeatedly, so this would create a sort of schedule for when to fill out relevant information.

- The Toasts would be used to notify individuals if they have filled out the necessary information and serve somewhat as a reminder to fill out information before events 'start'.
