The final project will be similar to the Health Check App that exists on Campus, but with some modifications. It will implement something similar to Criminal Intent, in the sense that there will be a list of events and times where the Check-In needs to be filled in as will implement forward and next buttons that are necessary during the times when account information is being filled in. Moreover, it will include Toasts in order to display. Let me know if this is okay.
